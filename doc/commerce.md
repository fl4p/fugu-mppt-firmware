# Organisation / Network

- Find people who want to be contribute
- Define a rough time line
- Think about the target group. Is it Arduino-hobbyist, campers..

# Software / Firmware

- Wifi AP: Targeting people that are not familiar with flashing MCU, the Setup Process needs to be streamlined with
  common practice.
  The device should start a WiFi Access Point so the average person can use their phone to setup WiFi connection, the
  ordinary proces.
- No hardcoded settings. Adjust Settings through the app, persistent storage
- Evaluate the current blynk app. Does it need a rewrite?
- Go through the github issues. It appears there are some (minor) bugs
- Implement OTA updates. This can be crucial

# Hardware Design

- is the 3D-printed housing good enough?
- does the product ship with a Display? Maybe as on option?
- Consider implementing a standard wire (CAN/R232..?) interface for PV System integration
- Evalute the battery and PV terminals. Are these too small?

# Manufacuring

- PCB Supply
- Part Supply
- PCB Assembly
- Toroid Coil assembly
- Housing and Cooling
- water resistance, varnish against moisture?

# Testing

- Give the device to a group of testers

# Documentation

- Write a Manual

# Branding

- Choose a Brand name and a Product name

# Certification

- Confirmity with local laws (CE etc)
- Liabilities, waranty
- Need legal entity?
- Choose an Open-Source License for Hardware and Software Design

# Financials

- How much will it cost to be profitable? Also need to consider risks of waranty claims.
