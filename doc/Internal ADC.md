# Poor ADC ?

The ESP32 internal ADC has a sloppy reputation.
It suffers from non-linearity and is known to be noisy. But is it really that bad?

The linearity can be fixed with calibration and we keep a margin to the ADC voltage range. (e.g. at 6dB PGA attenuation
150 mV ~ 1750 mV,
see [suggested range](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/adc.html#_CPPv425adc1_config_channel_atten14adc1_channel_t11adc_atten_t))
For simple curve fit see [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/164#issuecomment-318861287).
This can be improved with a look-up-table (LUT).

About the noise issue, we should take a closer look how we take measurements.
A simple and naive way is to set up a periodic timer and take a single-shot measurement with Arduino API `analogRead()`,
expecting a 12-bit precision. But what about conversion time? The shorter the AD conversion time, the higher the noise.
We didn't tell the ADC for how long to measure. If we measure the time `analogRead` takes until return, its only a
couple
10 microseconds. Digging through the code, we find that it calls `adc_oneshot_read`, `adc_oneshot_hal_convert`.
The ADC characteristics in the ESP32 data sheet show 2 Msps sampling rate with the DIG controller. So we can assume that
measurements are taken with sub-Âµs time, which explains the noise issue quite well.

A better approach is to start a continuous measurements at maximum sampling rate and average the samples so we get the
desired sampling rate. Averaging should be done with the raw adc int16 readings for best performance.

ESP32's internal ADC has non-linearity issues and is quite noisy.

We can reduce noise with a sliding mean filter, which reduces update rates.
The ESP32 ADC being much faster than the ADS1015, the reduced update rate is still sufficient for an MPPT application.

# Wiring

To use the internal ADC1 of the ESP32/ESP32-S3, just omit ADS1015 or ADS1115 (U10) and the ALERT 10k pull-up resistor
(R31).

The firmware will automatically switch to internal ADC1 if it doesn't find the ADS1015 or ADS1115 on the I2C bus.

Remove the ADS chip and the pull-up resistor next to it. Then use thin cables or isolated copper wire to
connect the analog signals directly with the ESP32 chip.

## ESP32-S3-WROOM-1

```
A2 (solar current) ---> GPIO4 (ADC1_CHANNEL_3)
A3 (solar voltage) ---> GPIO5 (ADC1_CHANNEL_4)
A4 (bat voltage)   ---> GPIO6 (ADC1_CHANNEL_5) (orignally ADC-ALERT)
```

## ESP32-WROOM-32

```
A2 (solar current) ---> GPIO36 / SENSOR_VP (ADC1_CHANNEL_0)
A3 (solar voltage) ---> GPIO34 (ADC1_CHANNEL_6) (orignally ADC-ALERT)
A4 (bat voltage)   ---> GPIO39 / SENSOR_VN (ADC1_CHANNEL_3) 
```

# Sampling Rate

We configure ESP32's ADC unit 1 in continuous mode with a sampling rate of 80 kHz (`adc_continuous_config`).
This means that the ADC does 80k conversions per second. We apply averaging of 32 samples to reduce the quite noisy
readings. With 4 channels this gives 625 samples per second per channel (80000 / 3 / 32).

On the ESP32-S3 we can achieve this theoretic rate, the ESP32 appears to be a bit slower (511 / 625 @ 80 kHz, 639 /
781 @ 100khz ) and always at ~80% of the calculated rate. This ratio is constant across tested sampling rates 80k, 100k,
125k, 128k, 156.25k, 160k, 200k, 250k, 312.5k, 320k and 400kHz.

At 640 kHz the ESP32 works at 70% of expected sampling rate and with significant variance. This might be due to a slow
control loop.


SOC_ADC_SAMPLE_FREQ_THRES_HIGH is 83333 for esp32s3 wtf?
* datasheet says it: 100k SPS :( https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3_datasheet_en.pdf#page=65
* https://esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=29554

esp32 has `SOC_ADC_SAMPLE_FREQ_THRES_HIGH          (2*1000*1000)`
* https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_datasheet_en.pdf#page=44
  * dig controller 2M SPS

* esp32s3
  * no info in datasheet? https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s2_datasheet_en.pdf#page=38
  * according to `scop_caps.h`: 83333 Hz

looks like esp32 is the only one with 2Msps
