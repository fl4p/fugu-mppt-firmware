# ina 226

- increase conversion time: reduce random noise, more aliasing
- averaging: eliminate aliasing of I and U readings due to sampling the i2c registers
- consider current sense input filter cut-off frequency and control loop update rate when tuning these values
- Voltage refresh rate should be <10ms, so max averaging is 64 and 140us conversion time (64 * 140us = 9ms)
    - note that we can use the ina226 OV alert feature and shutdown from an ISR



* one-shot (triggered) or continuous operation mode
* in one-shot mode re-write to config-register (value unchanged) to trigger a measurement
* the measurement will be available after (ConvTime_U + ConvTime_I) * AveragingSamples
* the chip can notify on conversion completion through ALERT signal
* averaging helps to reduce i2c data
* consider signal bandwidth and analog input filters when choosing the conversion time
* in continuous mode, latency for U both I is at least the max(ConvTime_U, ConvTime_I)
* standard pattern is interleaved sampling of U and I
* one-shot measurement can improve response time when using custom channel patterns or different conversion times

# averaging and conversion time
* see pg 13 https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina226.pdf#page=13
* averaging is low-pass filtering, reduce noise
* conversion time settings allows to increase precision for either U or I.



* reading a register at 800KHz bus speed takes ~155us (esp32s3)

# continuous mode with ready alert  

for some reason the conversion ready alert does not work if conversion time * averaging is too short:

* AVERAGE_1, CONV_TIME_588: loosing alert
* AVERAGE_4, CONV_TIME_204: looses alert (can call ina226.enableConvReadyAlert(); again)
* AVERAGE_1, CONV_TIME_1100: good (451sps)
* AVERAGE_4, CONV_TIME_1100: good (112sps)
