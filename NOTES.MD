# Sensor Code / reading ADC
scheduling the adc reads and accessing values is currently separated.
ADC_sampler does the scheduling.

Might be simpler to just use read callbacks? with these we can easily use multiple ADC devices, without the need
of complex scheduler code. do we actually need a scheduler? just read samples in the control loop and react.

considerations:
- support a combination of multiple ADCs (e.g. Vin ESP_ADC, Vout/Iout INA226)
- support sensing of Iin, Iout and both.
- ADCs can have very different sample rates and noise characteristics (filtering)


# Sample Rates
- ADS1015 i2c at 800 khz
- Loop: ads read only, wifi connected
- 344sps * 3ch = 1032adc/s


# Features / Improvements
- MAtter API? QR Code?
- use higher resolution PWM
  - is this possible? ESP32 timer freq appears to be 80mhz, 39khz*2048 = 79mhz
- instead of waiting for a full 3-tuple sample (vin,vout,iin), process data as soon as it is available


# Original Hardware Issues / Considerations
- Place filter caps closer to ADC input
- Place current sensor between after output filter capacitor
- Place backflow control FET on battery side

- 
- 
- running ewm filter bins
- around mpp P/u P/dutyCycle plots (real-time)
- fix detect battery voltage
- migrate to mcpwm api, which allows much higher frequencies
- real time capabilities of esp32, wifi and i2s, internal adc? xCreateTask
  - https://www.toptal.com/embedded/esp32-audio-sampling (use internal ADC and ISR)
- use pid https://github.com/AdysTech/PIDPWM
- wait 1 second for stable power supply > 10V, then start calibration
- random +-20 perturbs to handle hall noise
- FIX auto detect battery voltage
- Vout OV shutdown use 2 samples!
- reduce idle power (1-2W!! at night)
- use async UDP
- influxdb: write changed points only
- TODO slow down if DS cycle range is low (last X seconds)
- bug? 2core coil (120uH), 22 khz buck, Vin=58.8V, V_out=25.9V, duty cycle = 900 (precision 11bit)
when reaching max LS, current goes negative

- sweep after shutdown
- programmer header +EN +IO0
- sample mean between mppt updates


compute U,I noise sigma, P2P
estimate PV and battery impendance

# Hardware

- breakout (stackable for externsions) with 5v, 12V? supply
- bccu FET use SMD? HYG007N03LS1C2 (but this is 30V only!)

## Schematic
- Reset+Program Buttons
- programmer as extension?
- use sync bucks?
- put hall sensor before caps
- think about power supply. libreSolar switches to LV supply if available. does this really reduce power consumption? TODO remove HV diode? crowbar circuit?

## PCB
- esp32 bigger pads
- small buck coils footprint
- SMD electrolytic
- use bigger mosfet holes
- use bigger terminals (pv + battery terminal blocks p=13)
- terminal labels not visible
- label r12 not readable (at ntc)
- border around usb controller (to see which parts not to solder)

- replace hall sensor with shunt? the ACS712ELCTR-30A-T costs $2,73 (lcsc 10x 2023-02). see  ads1115 datasheet for current sense application with midpoint voltage 
- esp32 pin mount for easy replacement ( https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005002213376743.html )
- replace ADS1015 (which is hard to find in stock 2023-02) with  TLA2024 ?
- instead of isolated 12v power supply, use high-driver with bootstrapping
- step-down (synchronized) sop8 alternative?  https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/DC-DC-Converters_Anpec-Elec-APW7301KAI-TRG_C115136.html
- OLED display
- USB type-c connector
- -SPI outbreak for additional hardware /CAN
- 5V outbreak
- place hall sensor before capacitor!
- use 100nF-200nf Film capacitors for EMF reduction
- two temp sensors? (coil + fets)
- Snubber?
- 3.3V + 12V OV protection Zener-Diode + Fuse behind DCDC to protect components

## Simplifications
* Use ESP32 ADCs


## Common Ground
- do we need common ground?
- if not we can remove the BCCU DCDC
- makes shunt current sensing easier
- add R_sense and current amplifier (without common GND, put this on the low side and use ordinary OPV)

# Firmware
- OUTPUT voltage can get higher than expected! (sudden battery cut, such as Lifepo4 BMS)
. minimum ontime lower FET, otherwise
- handle negative current (set REC=1)
- choose a framework:
-- https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread
-- https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose-os
-- https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming
null- Zephyr
null- Mbed
- switching frequency? https://github.com/LibreSolar/mppt-2420-lc/issues/23#issuecomment-373252866

- store board indentifier in EEPROM so the FW can work on different boards and ESP32 pinout mappings

- go through the issues + pull requests on github
- Boost mode? from the battery terminals, the sync buck is a boost
- Bluetooth connection (setup?)


# Misc
- port to kicad or flux.ai ? ( https://github.com/jharvey/Charge_Controller )
- 2 channel version


# Extensions
Can be stacked on the I2C/SPI break out
- SD-Card
- CAN/RS434 interface


Fixes TODO
* It is actually possible to draw quite a lot of current from the PV input.
  it doesn't act as a real diode, current can flow as long as the voltage at the input capacitor is high enough
  should use differential current measurement. PV input is NOT short circuit proof!

* Use Alert Pin + Interrupt for faster reading
* Fix energy integration (millisRoutineInterval)

TODO
* Wifi AutoAp
* Settings Flash Storage
* WebInterface
* OTA Updates

* Github Issues
* OLED Display

* PWM soft start
* over mcu_temp cap Current
null* Silen Mode (reduce current instead of FAN switch on)

Ota update pull request:
https://github.com/AngeloCasi/FUGU-ARDUINO-MPPT-FIRMWARE/pull/23

breakout port for aux switches?
- ESP32 internal mcu_temp

Mppt ALgorithm Todo
- Filter noisy power loads (e.g. high-impedeance lead acid battery + inverter + macbook charger + macbook). Slow down mppt and use longer ewm
- Improve buck open circuit CV, CC

# Real Life Tests Results
PV 2s vs 2p:
With 2s HS FET gets hotter


- Add Backflow mosfet gate resistor to protect dcdc


# ESP32-S3
Footprint of side pins is equal to ESP32. There are 2 additional pins on the row opposing the antenna.
Since these pins are unused, we can just replace the ESP32 with a ESP32S3.

The S3 appears to have one bit lower LED PWM resolution, so instead of 2048 PWM values, there are 1024 only.
I2C can be assigned to arbitrary pins, no problem here. GPIO pin numbers are different, need to adjust in firmware.

S3 has USB on-board, so might remove the USB-to-UART chip.
