# FUGU-ARDUINO-MPPT-FIRMWARE

This is a complete re-write of the
original [AngeloCasi/FUGU-ARDUINO-MPPT-FIRMWARE](https://github.com/AngeloCasi/FUGU-ARDUINO-MPPT-FIRMWARE) .
It is compatible with
the [original hardware design](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-1kW-MPPT-Solar-Charge-Controller/) you can find on
Instructables.

The charger uses a simple CC-CV (constant current - constant voltage) approach.
This is common for Lithium-Batteries (e.g. LiFePo4, NCA, NCM, Sodium-Ion).

Highlights:

* Supports ESP32 and ESP32-S3
* Async ADC sampling for low latency control loop (<900Âµs in-out latency)
* ADC abstraction layer with implementations for ESP32(S3) [Internal ADC](doc/Internal%20ADC.md), ADS1x15 and
  INA226/INA228
* Automatic zero-current calibration
* PID control for precise voltage and current regulation
* Periodic MPPT global search
* Sophisticated [Diode Emulation](#synchronous-buck-and-diode-emulation) for low-side switch
* Supports buck and boost conversion
* Battery voltage detection
* Fast protection shutdown in over-voltage and over-current conditions
* PWM Fan Control and temperature power de-rating
* Telemetry to InfluxDB over UDP
* LCD (hd44780) and WS2812B LED Indicator
* Configuration files on flash file system (littlefs)
* [Serial UART console](doc/Console.md) and telnet to interact with the charger
* Unit tests, on-board [performance profiler](https://github.com/LiluSoft/esp32-semihosting-profiler/)

The firmware sends real-time data to InfluxDB server using UDP line protocol.

The aim of this program is to provide a flexible MPPT and DC/DC converter solution that you can use with various
hardware topologies (e.g. buck & boost, location of current sensor).
You can configure pins, limits, converter topology and sensors through config files, without the need to rebuild the
firmware.
Access files through FTP or USB Mass Storage Class (MSC, ESP32-S3).
I tried to structure components in classes, so they reflect the physical and logical building-blocks of a MPPT solar
charger.
See [Voltage & Current Sensors, ADC](#voltage--current-sensors-adc (ADC))

# Reference Hardware

* [Fugu2](https://github.com/fl4p/Fugu2) (KiCad)
    * Dual parallel HS switches
    * Snubber circuit for reduced EMI
    * INA226 current sensor
* [Original Fugu](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-1kW-MPPT-Solar-Charge-Controller/) (Proteus)

# Getting Started

1. Build and flash the firmware
2. Flash the configuration (provisioning)
3. Calibrate the ADC (important for proper diode emulation)

You can build with ESP-IDF toolchain using Arduino as a component.

If you want to use PlatformIO, checkout `tag/pio-last`. The PIO build branch is currently not maintained.
This version works with the original Fugu design. Mind the voltage divider values. ADS1015 and ACS712-30 hall.

## Building with ESP-IDF

Follow [Espressif's Get Started guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.1.4/esp32/get-started/index.html)
to install ESP-IDF v5.1.4. (The firmware depends on `arduino-esp32` which is compatible with `esp-idf v5.1`.)
You can follow these commands: (make sure you have all the prerequisites from
the Espressif guide and you might have to downgrade python to 3.9 if running into issues
like [this](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/12322), note that esp-idf will create a new python virtual
environment with your system's default python version `python --version`):

```
git clone -b v5.1.4 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git esp-idf-v5.1
cd esp-idf-v5.1
./install.sh esp32s3
 . ./export.sh
```

Build the MPPT firmware:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/fl4p/fugu-mppt-firmware
cd fugu-mppt-firmware
idf.py set-target esp32s3 # (or esp32)
idf.py build
idf.py flash
```

## Configuring Build

* Set environment variable `RUN_TESTS=1` to run unit-tests
* `FUGU_BAT_V`: hard-code the battery voltage. If not set the program tries to detect bat voltage from a multiple of
  14.6V.

## Board Configuration

The firmware reads IO pin mappings, sensor and system (I2C, WiFi, etc.) configuration values from `.conf` files on
the `littlefs`
partition.
This enables easy OTA updates of the firmware across various hardware configurations. And you can easily alter the
configuration by flashing a new `littlefs` image or by editing the files over FTP. Some crucial parameters are still
hard-coded, making them configurable is WIP.

You find existing board configuration in the folder [`provisioning/`](provisioning/):

* `fmetal`: [Fugu2 board](https://github.com/fl4p/Fugu2)
* `fugu_int_adc`: original fugu design but using the [internal ADC](doc/Internal%20ADC.md)
* `dry_mock`: uses a mock ADC producing sinusoidal readings, useful for testing with ESP32 dev boards
* `dry_int`: uses the internal ADC for dry testing

Chose the board and flash these config files (set `PROV` to the name of the folder under `provisioning/`):

```
BOARD=dry
littlefs-python create provisioning/$BOARD $BOARD.bin -v --fs-size=0x20000 --name-max=64 --block-size=4096
parttool.py --port /dev/cu.usb* write_partition --partition-name littlefs --input $BOARD.bin
```

Alternatively, in `CMakeLists.txt`, add `FLASH_IN_PROJECT` argument for `littlefs_create_partition_image()`. Then the
config files will be flashed with the next `idf.py flash`:

```
littlefs_create_partition_image(littlefs provisioning/fmetal
  FLASH_IN_PROJECT
)
```

Once you've built and flashed the firmware on the device, use the serial console to connect the chip to your
Wi-Fi network:

```
idf.py monitor
> wifi-add <ssid>:<password>
> restart
```

If Wi-Fi connection is successful you will be able to connect with telnet and FTP.
You can send the same commands over telnet as over the [Serial console](doc/Serial%20Console.md).

Use FTP to upload HW configuration files to configure IO pins, ADC and converter topology.
Note that FTP server is unstable. It seems to work well with the Filezilla client.
FTP settings: 1 simultaneous connection, disable passive mode.

# Control Loop

The control loop reads Vout, Vin, Iin and adjusts the PWM duty cycle of the buck DC-DC converter for MPPT and output
regulation. The control loop updates once a Vout reading is available. This ensures low latency for output voltage
control, which is important (see below).

Besides the MPP tracker, the control loop contains 5 PD control units (PID without the integral component):

- `VinCTRL` (solar voltage), keeps solar voltage above 10.5V to prevent board supply UV
- `IinCTRL` (solar current), limits input current to protect hardware
- `VoutCTRL` (bat voltage), regulates the output voltage when battery is full or disconnected
- `IoutCTRL` (charge current), controls the charge current
- `PowerCTRL` (thermal derating), limits conversion power to prevent excess temperatures

The `VoutCTRL` is the fastest controller. Keeping the output voltage in-range with varying load is most crucial to
prevent damage from transient over-voltage. Because a solar panel is very similar to a constant current
source, `IinCTRL` and `IoutCTRL` can be slower.

`IoutCTRL` and `PowerCTRL` both have variable set-points, provided by charging algorithm and temperature feedback,
respectively.

In each loop iteration we update all controllers and pick the one with the lowest response value. If it is positive, we
can proceed with the MPPT. Otherwise, we halt MPPT and decrease the duty cycle proportionally to the control value.

# Voltage & Current Sensors (ADC)

The firmware tries to be as hardware independent as possible by using layers of abstraction (HAL), so you can easily
adopt it
with your ADC model and topology. Implementations exist for the ADS1x15, INA226, esp32_adc.

The hardware should always sense `Vin` and `Vout`. `Vin` is not crucial and can
be coarse (8-bit ADC might be ok if there is a current sensor at `Iout`), it is needed for diode emulation in DCM,
under- and
over-voltage shutdown. Since `Vout` is our
battery voltage it should be more precise.
To reduce voltage transients during load change a high sampling rate is prefered.

The current sensor can be either at the input (`Iin`, solar) or output (`Iout`, battery) or both. If there's only one
current sensor we
can infer the other current using the voltage ratio and efficiency of the converter.
The code represents this with a `VirtualSensor`.

If the current sensor is bi-directional, the converter can operate in boost mode, boosting lower solar voltage to a
higher battery voltage. This is not yet implemented.

Here are some relevant types:

* `LinearTransform`: Simple 1-dimensional linear transform (Y = a*X + b) to scale voltage readings and zero-offsetting.
* `ADC_Sampler`: Schedules ADC reads, manages sensors and their calibration
* `CalibrationConstraints`: value constraints a sensor must meet during calibration (average, stddev).
* `Sensor`: Represents a physical sensor with running statistics (average, variance)
* `VirtualSensor`: A sensor with computed values. Also comes with running stats.
* `AsyncADC`: Abstract interface for asynchronous (non-blocking) ADC implementation

Asynchronous here means that we request a sample from the ADC and continue code execution while the conversion is
happening. This improves average CPU utilization and other things can run smoothly even with a slow ADC.

# MPPT Algorithm

The tracking consists of 3 phases:

1. Global scan (aka search, sweep)
2. Fast tracking (observe & perturb)
3. Slow tracking (observe & perturb)

The controller starts with a global scan, at a duty cycle of 0 and linearly increases it while capturing the
maximum power point (MPP) until one of these conditions are met:
input under-voltage, output over-voltage, over-current, max duty cycle.

It then sets the duty cycle to the captured MPP and goes into fast tracking mode to follow the MPP locally.

After a while it switches to slow tracking mode, trying to reduce the mean tracking error.
When it detects a mayor change in power conditions (e.g. clouds, partial shading), it'll switch back to fast tracking,
to quickly adapt to the new condition.

A global scan is triggered every 30 minutes to prevent getting stuck in a local maximum. This can happen with partially
shaded solar strings. A scan lasts about 20 to 60 seconds, depending on the loop update rate. Scanning too often or slow
scanning ca significantly less reduce overall efficiency.

# Synchronous Buck and Diode Emulation

We can leave the Low-Side (LS, aka *sync-FET*, *synchronous rectifier*) switch off and the coil discharge current will
flow through the LS MOSFETÂ´s body diode.
The buck converter then operates in non-synchronous mode with reduced conversion efficiency since the mosfet body diode
usually has a voltage drop of around 1V.

Turning on the LS must be taken with care to prevent the converter from becoming a (reversed) boost converter.
Switching the LS for too long causes reverse current flow from battery to solar and can cause high voltage at the solar
input. The high current can destroy the LS switch and the high voltage can destroy the whole board. So we must take
timing the LS switch with a lot of care.

The firmware implements a synchronous buck converter with sensor-less diode emulation. It uses the Vin, Vout and coil
inductance value to estimate the coil ripple current and adjusts the switching time of the LS MOSFET so that the current
never crosses zero.
It handles both Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) and Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM). Inductor core saturation is
modelled using a constant -5% inductance drop, which appears to be reasonably accurate. This inaccuracy is only
noticeable during operation near the CCM/DCM transition point, and it usually causes the rectification switch to turn
off too early. If you experience reverse inductor current, decrease `L0` value.
A more accurate model would use the DC-bias curve from the core material's datasheet.
See [Diode Emulation](doc/Diode%20Emulation.md) for more details and formulae.

For additional safety the low-side duty cycle is slowly faded to its maximum value. As soon as we detect reverse
current (which might also be noise), we decrease the LS switch duty cycle and slowly recover.

## Issues

* There is a design issue with `IoutCTRL` and `PowerCTRL`. In an over-load situation, the controllers will
  decrease duty-cycle, which can increase solar voltage, thus increase conversion power. In this case the converter will
  increases power until it runs into the hard
  limits, shuts down and recovers. Because this is a transient situation, it should not cause any damage to hardware.

# Using this Firmware

I am currently using this firmware on a couple of Fugu Devices in a real-world application. Each device is connected to
2s 410WP solar panels, charging an 24V LiFePo4 battery. They produce more than 4 kWh on sunny days.

I'd consider the current state of this software as usable. However, a lot of things (WiFi, charging parameters) are
hard-coded. ADC filtering and control loop speed depend on the quality of measurements (noise, outliers) and need to be
adjusted manually.

The original Fugu HW design has some flaws (hall sensor placement after input caps, hall sensor too close to coil,
sense wires layout). Using the CSD19505 at the HS is not a good idea: it is a MOSFET designed for rectificiation and has
a large Qrr (body diode reverse recovery charge) which will cause a lot of ringing noise.

Interference increases with power, so we can slow down the control loop to ensure a steady output. Otherwise the
converter might repeatedly shutdown, wasting solar energy. A slow control loop however causes higher voltage
transients during load changes (e.g. BMS cut-off) which can be dangerous for devices.

If the battery or load is removed during power conversion expect an over-voltage transient at the output.
With a battery voltage of 28.5V, I measured 36V for 400ms.

Keep in mind that in case of a failure (software or hardware), the charger might permanently output the max solar
voltage at the battery terminal, potentially destroying any connected device. Add over-voltage protection (another
DC/DC, Varistor, TVS, crowbar circuit) if necessary.

Use it at your own risk.
